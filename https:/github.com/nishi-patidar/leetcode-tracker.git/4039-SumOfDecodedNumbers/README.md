# 4039. Sum of Decoded Numbers

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-decoded-numbers/)

---

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Each `nums[i]` is an **encoded** integer representing two positive integers `x_i` and `y_i`. To decode `nums[i]`, define:

- `width_i = nums[i] % 10`.
- `d_i = floor(nums[i] / 10)`.
- `x_i` as the integer formed by the first `width_i` digits of the decimal representation of `d_i`.
- `y_i` as the integer formed by all remaining digits of the decimal representation of `d_i`.

It is guaranteed that the decimal representation of `d_i` contains more than `width_i` digits. Therefore, both `x_i` and `y_i` contain at least one digit.

The **decoded value** of `nums[i]` is `x_i^yi`.

Return the sum of the decoded values of all elements in `nums`, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The `floor()` function returns the integer part of the division.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [231]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

- For 231, we have `width = 1`, `d = 23`, `x = 2`, and `y = 3`.
- The decoded value of 231 is `2^3 = 8`.
- Since there is only one element in `nums`, the sum of the decoded values is 8.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2522,2101]

**Output:** 1649

**Explanation:**

- For 2522, we have `width = 2`, `d = 252`, `x = 25`, and `y = 2`.
- The decoded value of 2522 is `25^2 = 625`.
- For 2101, we have `width = 1`, `d = 210`, `x = 2`, and `y = 10`.
- The decoded value of 2101 is `2^10 = 1024`.
- The sum of the decoded values is `625 + 1024 = 1649`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [2301]

**Output:** 73741817

**Explanation:**

- For 2301, we have `width = 1`, `d = 230`, `x = 2`, and `y = 30`.
- The decoded value is `2^30 = 1073741824`.
- Therefore, the answer is `1073741824 modulo (10^9 + 7) = 73741817`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `100 < nums[i] < 10^15`
- `1 <= width_i <= 9`
- `1 <= x_i, y_i < 10^9`
- The digit sequences used to form `x_i` and `y_i` do not have leading zeros.
- It is guaranteed that every element in `nums` is a valid encoded integer.
